# ≈†kola matematike Matka (Website)

This repository is the repository of the website for the mathematics and
physics school ≈†kola matematike Matka.

## Set up local environment üõ†Ô∏è

In order to run the project locally, you need to install
[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). After the installation of
XAMPP is completed, you will get a xampp folder on your machine. Go to the
htdocs folder which is located in the xampp folder. In the htdocs folder clone
this repository. After that, open the XAMPP CONTROL PANEL application and click
start on Apache. Now visit localhost/skola-matematike-matka-website in your
browser and you will get the website. When you make a change in the code, or
write something new, you need to refresh the page manually to see the changes.
If your css and js changes don't apply, try to cleare the cache of the page and
make a hard reload. If that doesn't work, then restart Apache.
